Implementation
	I had an infinite while loop that prints out "whoosh> " to simulate the 
bash running. The input is taken in and split by white space. The input is 
then parsed to check if it's "exit", "pwd", "cd", "path", or an existing 
executable in the path locations. Exit just calls the exit(0) syscall. 
Pwd uses a child process to call getcwd() to get the current directory.
Cd calls chdir to change the current directory. If there is an argument, 
cd will check if the directory exists and go to the directory. If there isn't
an argument, it'll go to the home directory. If there is more than 1 argument,
it will print an error. 
Path changes the PATH to the specified directories. If they don't exist, 
it returns an error. 
I check if an executable already exists in the PATH by calling stat. Then,
I fork and have the child process read in the arguments and call execv to
execute the command. 
For redirection, I use open to create the files and dup to change where
the stdout redirects to.
